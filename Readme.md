# ⚡ Frontend Machine Coding Practice

This repo contains a collection of small **Vanilla JS projects** I built to practice **core frontend concepts** often asked in interviews.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. 📸 [Smart Image Gallery](./image-gallery)
Practice with **browser APIs**:
- Lazy loading with `IntersectionObserver`
- Infinite scroll
- Like button animation using `requestAnimationFrame`
- LocalStorage persistence
- Event delegation
<!-- - MutationObserver & ResizeObserver
- Web Worker offloading -->


---

### 2. 🧮 [Calculator App](./calculator)
Practice with **DOM handling & basics**:
- Number/operator input handling
- Dynamic expression building
- Safe evaluation with `try/catch`
- Responsive button layout with hover states


---

### 3. ❌⭕ [Tic Tac Toe](./tic-tac-toe)
Practice with **state management in Vanilla JS**:
- Dynamic 3×3 board rendering
- Turn-based play with state array
- Winner detection (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Reset functionality
- Prevent invalid moves


---

## 🧠 Key Learnings Across Projects
- Event Bubbling/Capturing & Delegation
- `event.stopPropagation()` usage
- LocalStorage vs SessionStorage vs Cookies
- Timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`) vs `requestAnimationFrame`
- Web Workers / Shared Workers for heavy work
- IntersectionObserver for lazy loading & infinite scroll
<!-- - ResizeObserver & MutationObserver for responsive UI handling -->
- Vanilla JS state management (like React’s `useState` idea)
